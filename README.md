# Stock Market Prediction using Deep Learning and python

First let me say it is extremely hard to try and predict the stock market. Even people with a good understanding of statistics and probabilities have a hard time doing this. This is a small project where it tries to predict if a stock will rise or fall with a certain percentage through giving probabilities of what events it thinks will happen.
